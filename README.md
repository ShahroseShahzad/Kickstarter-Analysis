# Kickstarting with Excel


## Overview of Project
For UofT Data Analytics & Visualization Bootcamp our first challenge consists of 3 key deliverables based on Kickstarter data. Which includes a written analysis for:

1) Outcomes based on Launch Date Chart to visualize campaign outcomes.
2) Outcomes based on Funding Goals Chart to visualize campaign outcomes.
3) Results  for these two in readme.md file.

We will use Microsoft Excel in MAC as well as Visual Studio Code to help Louise visualize her Campaign Project at a glace. The data that we will be using is from the Kick Starter dataset that is saved in a workbook called â€œKickstarter_ Challenge.

With data visualization Louise can see the outcomes of all the categories, summary tables, charts, and graphs.

### Purpose

The purpose of this project is to visualize Kickstarter campaign outcomes for Louise based on their launch dates and their funding goals. We will utilize the knowledge obtained throughout the modules and course work to demonstrate Excel skills using pivot tables and graphing to visualize campaign outcomes:

A. Successful B. Canceled C. Failed

## Analysis and Challenges

Louise's play 'Fever - a workshop production' needed to meet its donations goal amount of $2885 from the KickStarter campaign. The blurb of the play was designed to support the artists of the new play FEVER: a story of love, friendship and sonnets. This was going to be achieved with the donations collected from the KickStarter campaign. The campaign launched on the June 13, 2016 for 28 days and ended on July 11, 2016 However, the play failed to reach it's pledge goal by $400 which comes out to 13% of the targed amount.

The data set contains the following columns: A. id B. name C. blurb D. goal E. pledged F. outcomes G. country H. currency I. deadline  J. launched_at  K. staff_pick L. backers_count M. spotlight N. category and subcategory O. percentage Funded P. average donations  Q. parent category R. sub category S. date created  T. date ended  U. year

The following is an analysis for campaign outcomes based on their launch dates and their funding goals.


### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date

In this graph we can see the data for successful, failed and canceled campaigns based on their launch date. The months are on the x axis and the outcomes are on the y-axis.

According to the data the most successful month for based on the launch date for the Kickstarter Campaign was May. We can see a downward trend from May onwards for all plays. Louise should start her campaign for the month of May. The failed trend is lower than the successful campaigns. The worst month to campaign is during the winter in December.

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals

In this graph we can see the outcome of the campaign, whether it's successful, failed or cancled based on goal for the campaign.
According to the data the most successful campaign was either under $1000 or between $35000-$45000. When the campaign goal exceeded $45000, no one was interested to pledge for the campaign. We would need more information to analyze other variables causing the failed campaigns to be higher under the $35000 goal.

### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered

We need more information to better analyise the graph to find out what ouside variables are causing the trend to move in a certain direction.

I faced a challange with creating SSH key for Git Hub. But with the help of T.A I was able to over come the issue.

## Results

- What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?

The most successful months for theater were in summer during May, June and July.
The failed trend is fairly consistent. It did not change drasticaly during the months the theater campaign had successful outcome.

- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?

The most successful campaings were either with the goal under 1000, or between 35000 to 45000.
There were no play campaings canceled 

- What are some limitations of this dataset?

There is not enough information to find out exactly what outside variables are effecting the trends so drastically. 

- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?

We could create a pivot chart for plays 
A Box Plot of the US Theater Plays by Goals and Pledged. Looking at the outcome of US plays in terms of overall Failed, Live, Successful and Cancelled.
